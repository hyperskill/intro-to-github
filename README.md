# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in th1s repo because you are not a *collaborator*.

The **Issues** tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by *Open* and *Closed*.

The **Pull requests** tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request (PR)* to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may *fork* it, modify the content, and create *PR*. A *fork* is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.
