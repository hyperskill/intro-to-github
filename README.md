# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a *collaborator*.

The **Issues** tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by *Open* and *Closed*.

The **Pull requests** tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request (PR)* to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may *fork* it, modify the content, and create *PR*. A *fork* is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.

A fork is a copy of a repository. It allows you to freely experiment with it without affecting the original project. 
A fork is just a regular repository hosted on GitHub like the original one. You can add new files and modify them or remove existing ones in your fork.

Local repository.
If I understand correctly, Git has two sorts of repositories: one called local, another called remote. ... Git local repository is the one on which we will make local changes, typically this local repository is on our computer. Git remote repository is the one of the server, typically a machine situated at 42 miles away.
