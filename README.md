# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a *collaborator*.

The **Issues** tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by *Open* and *Closed*.

The **Pull requests** tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request (PR)* to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may *fork* it, modify the content, and create *PR*. A *fork* is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.

**Forking** is when you create a copy of someone else's Git repo (usually via GitHub) to your own account. This allows you to make changes to the codebase without affecting the original repo. You can then make changes to your forked copy and create pull requests to merge those changes back into the original repo you forked from.

**Branching** is when you create a copy of your own codybase within the same repo. This allows you to make changes to your codebase without affecting the main branch (usually called "master" or "main"). You can create new branches for different features or bug gixes, and merge those branches back into the main branch whenever you're ready.

Think of forking as creating a copy of someone else's codebase, and branching as creating a copy of your own codebase.
