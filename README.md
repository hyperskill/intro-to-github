# Git: Local work
The standard approach to work with a project is to have a local copy of the repository and commit your changes to this copy rather than to a remote repo hosted on GitHub through the web interface. 

This local repository has full version history of the project that can be useful when working without an internet connection. 

After you've changed something in the local repo, you can push your changes to the remote repository to make them visible to other developers.



I have made some improvements, see below: 

This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a *collaborator*.

The **Issues** tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by *Open* and *Closed*.

The **Pull requests** tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request (PR)* to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may *fork* it, modify the content, and create *PR*. A *fork* is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.

A fork is a copy of a repository. It allows you to freely experiment with it without affecting the original project. To make a fork, you must log into GitHub.

Branching, provides a way to work on different versions of a repository at the same time.
