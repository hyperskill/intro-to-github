# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a *collaborator*.

The **Issues** tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by *Open* and *Closed*.

The **Pull requests** tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request (PR)* to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may *fork* it, modify the content, and create *PR*. A *fork* is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.

Forks:
Forks allow users to create a copy of a GitHub repository under their own account. This copy enables them to make changes independently of the original repository. Forks are commonly used for contributing to open-source projects by making changes and submitting pull requests. They also serve as a way to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Branching:
Branching allows users to create separate lines of development within a repository. This enables developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without altering the main or master branch. Branches are useful for organizing work and isolating changes, making it easier to track issues and manage development tasks.
