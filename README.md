# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a *collaborator*.

The **Issues** tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by *Open* and *Closed*.

The **Pull requests** tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request (PR)* to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may *fork* it, modify the content, and create *PR*. A *fork* is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.

Additionally, the Projects tab can be utilized to organize and manage tasks, assignees, and deadlines. It's a useful feature for coordinating efforts and tracking progress on various aspects of the project.

Furthermore, the Wiki tab offers a space for collaborative documentation. Users can create and edit pages to provide additional information, guidelines, or tutorials related to the project.

Feel free to explore these tabs and engage with the community to contribute to the project's growth and improvement. Your input and contributions are valuable!
