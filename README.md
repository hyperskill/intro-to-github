# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a *collaborator*.

The **Issues** tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by *Open* and *Closed*.

The **Pull requests** tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request (PR)* to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may *fork* it, modify the content, and create *PR*. A *fork* is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.

today is September 8, 2021 and i'm learning about GitHub. 

- GitHub is a platform that hosts your code online
- all your code is in a repository 
- if you don't have collaborator access to a repository (like this one)
- you can 'fork' the repository which creates an isolated snapshot of the repository under your profile
- you can submit pull requests and those with collaborator access can decide to merge with the repo

now we've created a branch 
- we will modify the readme file
- then commit the change
