# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a *collaborator*.

The **Issues** tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by *Open* and *Closed*.

The **Pull requests** tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request (PR)* to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may *fork* it, modify the content, and create *PR*. A *fork* is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.

In October 2018 GitHub has launched **Actions**, its workflow automation tool. GitHub Actions has evolved to give developers powerful automation and CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment) capabilities right next to your code in GitHub.

**Insights > Network**
The network graph displays the branch history of the entire repository network, including branches of the root repository and branches of forks that contain commits unique to the network.

As of **October 1, 2020** the default branch name for newly-created repositories is **main**.
