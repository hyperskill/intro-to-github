# intro-to-github

This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:

- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a _collaborator_.

The **Issues** tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by _Open_ and _Closed_.

The **Pull requests** tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an _Issue_ or make a _Pull request (PR)_ to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may _fork_ it, modify the content, and create _PR_. A _fork_ is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.
