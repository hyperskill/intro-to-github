# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request (PR)* to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may *fork* it, modify the content, and create *PR*. A *fork* is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.
