# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the **Code** tab:
- **README.md** is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
- **.gitignore** is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a *collaborator*.
