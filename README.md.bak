#intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the Code tab:

README.md is a file that describes this repo (you are currently reading it)
.gitignore is a file that specifies which files and directories must be ignored by Git
You cannot directly modify files in this repo because you are not a collaborator.

The Issues tab is used to discuss ideas, enhancements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by Open and Closed.

The Pull requests tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an Issue or make a Pull request (PR) to contribute to the project.

If you want to propose some changes to this repo, you may fork it, modify the content, and create PR. A fork is just a copy that allows you to change the content without affection the original project.

Additionally, the Projects tab is a place where you can organize and prioritize work in your repository. You can create boards to track issues and pull requests and prioritize them based on their importance and deadline.

The Wiki tab is a place where you can store additional information and documentation related to your repository. You can use it to document the project's history, design decisions, user guides, and so on.

The Pulse tab is a summary of recent activity in your repository, including pushes, pull requests, issues, and comments. This is a great place to get a quick overview of what's happening in your repo.

GitHub also offers features such as code reviews, collaboration tools, and project management features that make it a great platform for open-source projects as well as private projects. With GitHub, you can work on projects with others from anywhere in the world, and track progress and changes in real-time.

In conclusion, GitHub is a powerful platform that offers a range of features to support software development and collaboration. Whether you're working on a solo project or collaborating with others, GitHub can help you keep track of your code and streamline your development process.
